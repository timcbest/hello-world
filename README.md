# hello-world

I am a lens based visual artist that uses film, digital, and video processes to make large scale prints.  Additionally I work for an IT company for my day job where I am a solution architect.  I have always programmed throughout my dual career utilizing Open Frameworks, C, PHP, on open source platforms to make visual installations.  I am interested in continuing my practice here on Git Hub with the hope of finding employment in a creative endeavor such as publications, PSAs, entertainment, or advertising.
